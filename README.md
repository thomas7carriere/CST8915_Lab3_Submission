# CST8915_Lab3_Submission

I created three new repositories for the Product-Service, Order-Service and Store-Front as the previous lab hasn't been graded yet and didn't want to affect it.

Product-Service: https://github.com/thomas7carriere/CST8915_Lab3_Product_Service
Order-Service: https://github.com/thomas7carriere/CST8915_Lab3_Order_Service
Store-Front: https://github.com/thomas7carriere/CST8915_Lab3_Store_Front

Reflection Questions:

- What challenges did you encounter when configuring environment variables in the GitHub Actions workflow?
- How does deploying microservices on Azure Web App Service differ from running them locally?
- Why is it important to use environment variables for configurations in a cloud environment?
